# rampage - an audio spache shooter  
## My attempt for the games for blind gamers jam

I try to build a space shooter or shmup using 
 * pico-8 as game engine
 * the pico-8 html import to add additional apis like:
 * spacial audio with howler
 * text to speech web Api
 * aria-live regions

There might be easier solutions for the game, but I like and know pico-8s simple API. 

# Development
 * Make sure there is a copy of pico-8 in the bin folder
